            "Create a 2D K-Drama Manhwa-style digital illustration of the subject, replicating his real-world facial structure, facial mass, maturity, and expression exactly before applying any stylization. No anatomical slimming, beautification, anime exaggeration, or Korean idolization is allowed. Accurately replicate the subject’s real face volume distribution, including cheek width, jaw thickness, chin structure, forehead size, and temple fullness without any beautification or reshaping. Match the real-world nose structure by preserving bridge width, tip definition, and nostril shape without narrowing. Eye size, spacing, tilt, and depth must match precisely as seen in the original reference, with no enlargement, smoothing, or anime-style modifications. Preserve mouth width, lip fullness, lip curvature, and overall expression exactly as observed. Eyebrow thickness, arch shape, and positioning must be matched naturally. The hairstyle should be replicated exactly, preserving hairline, hair density, texture (whether straight, wavy, or curly), and graying if present. Accessories like glasses, earrings, or rings must only be included if visible in the original photo — no invented or added accessories are allowed. Softly retain all natural signs of age, including forehead lines, eye wrinkles, nasolabial folds (smile lines), under-eye depth, and cheek skin texture, reflecting the subject's real-world maturity. These features must be integrated naturally into the illustration, maintaining a clean 2D Manhwa look without heavy wrinkling, smoothing, rejuvenation, or beautification. After complete anatomical preservation, stylize the artwork in a K-Drama Manhwa style featuring realistic but clean lines, deep cinematic shading, soft lighting, and an emotionally charged atmosphere. Dress the subject in a stylish modern suit with sharp tailoring, subtle fabric texture, a slightly open-collar shirt, and minimal accessories like a simple watch or ring to match K-Drama lead aesthetics. Set the background in a rain-soaked narrow city street at night, with reflective wet ground, dim neon Korean signs in the distance, mist rising gently around the subject’s feet, and puddles reflecting scattered city lights to create a dramatic noir effect. Add visible rain droplets falling through the air, faint drifting fog along the ground, distant lens flares from streetlights, and small glowing embers floating around the scene to heighten the cinematic mood. Maintain the subject’s real-world stern and serious pose exactly, without modifying posture or body structure. Enhance the emotional impact through deep manhwa-style facial shadowing, keeping the subject’s expression cold but emotionally intense, in line with a revenge drama protagonist. Full facial identity, face mass, and natural maturity must be preserved before any environmental, clothing, or atmospheric effects are applied. Stylization must only affect the linework, shading, outfit, and background — never alter the subject’s anatomy or facial features."

Set the background in a rain-soaked narrow street at night, with glistening wet pavement, softly glowing neon Korean signage in the distance, light mist curling near the ground, and puddles reflecting blurred city lights to create a moody noir ambiance. Add gentle rain falling through the scene, soft fog at ankle level, faint drifting embers in the air, and occasional light flares from the neon signage to heighten the cinematic drama and atmosphere. Maintain a graceful yet tense posture matching the subject’s real-world pose. Enhance the facial expression with intense manhwa-style shadowing; the expression should feel melancholic yet steeled, evoking strength through sorrow, like a heroine caught in a bittersweet revenge story.

      "Create a head-to-waist digital illustration of the given subject in a polished Manhwa (Korean comic) fantasy style, with cinematic color grading and clean linework. Strictly replicate the subject’s real-world face and physical characteristics without beautification, anime exaggeration, or Korean idolization. Accurately replicate the subject’s real face shape, cheek volume, jawline thickness, forehead width, and full facial mass without slimming, reshaping, or beautifying. Match the real-world nose structure exactly, including bridge shape, nostril form, and nose size without narrowing or stylization. Preserve natural eye size, spacing, tilt, and depth precisely as seen — no enlargement, no anime-style adaptation, no smoothing. Replicate lip shape, lip thickness, and mouth positioning exactly. Maintain any facial hair such as beard, stubble, or mustache exactly as visible, with no cleaning, modification, or stylization. If the subject is wearing glasses, replicate the exact frame design, thickness, and fit; if glasses are not present, do not add any. Accurately replicate the hairstyle, including hairline, hair texture, and any visible aging signs such as thinning, graying, or hair volume changes. Subtly preserve all visible signs of maturity, including forehead lines, under-eye depth, nasolabial folds (smile lines), natural skin texture, and slight volume loss or fullness in the face. Age realism must be softly integrated into the illustration without exaggerating wrinkles, hardening features, or over-smoothing the skin. The subject should maintain a mature but polished and cinematic appearance — capturing natural aging realistically but elegantly. After locking all anatomical and facial features, apply stylization. Dress the subject in a modern K-pop fantasy-style outfit, such as a tailored jacket, coat, or suit, featuring intricate mystical embroidery and a belted waist design that enhances the fantasy atmosphere while retaining realistic proportions. Add artistic effects around the subject, including a glowing magical aura around the hands, soft floating cosmic lights, subtle fiery sparks, and swirling atmospheric energy to create a polished fantasy look. The background should depict a deep red mystical environment filled with swirling smoke, sparks, lightning cracks, and cinematic lighting to amplify the fantasy cinematic vibe. The subject’s pose and natural facial expression must be matched exactly without alteration. Maintain a confident, serene, and powerful expression, ensuring that emotional authenticity and body posture remain true to the original reference without forced adjustments or exaggeration. Prioritize facial identity and natural age realism first before any atmospheric or costume stylization is applied. Stylization must be strictly limited to atmosphere, lighting, background, and outfit design — never to the subject’s anatomy, face mass, features, wrinkles, or visible accessories. The final result must maintain a careful balance: preserving realistic anatomy, subtle natural maturity, and presenting a clean, polished, cinematic fantasy look without beautification, Korean idolization, over-smoothing, or addition of non-visible accessories."
