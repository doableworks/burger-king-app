            "Turn this bald, brown-skinned man with a long gray beard and glasses into a K-drama manhwa-style character. Preserve his facial structure: the round head, distinguished beard, and glasses — with a refined update to the frames for a modern touch. Render his eyes deep and expressive with a subtle sadness or calm. Keep the wrinkles and beard intact, stylized in clean Manhwa linework. Style him in a long dark coat or tailored formalwear typical of K-drama protagonists. The background should be a moody Seoul alley at night, glowing with soft neon lights or gentle rain reflections. Convey a deep emotional aura while staying true to his original appearance."

          "Turn this bald, brown-skinned woman into a K-drama manhwa-style character. Keep her facial identity intact — from the natural contours of her face to any wrinkles or distinctive features. Add softly flowing hair, styled modestly, and minimal but refined makeup. Her eyes should reflect calm or sorrow, in the emotional and elegant tone of a K-drama heroine. Dress her in a sleek coat or elegant layered outfit, subtle in color. Use a soft, rainy Seoul night background with muted neon glow or city lights. The mood should be introspective and emotional, true to K-drama tones while preserving her original look."

      "K-Pop":{
  "male": [
      "Generate a head-to-waist Korean Manhwa-style 2D illustration of a K-pop performer. The subject’s facial identity and age must be preserved with complete accuracy, including their original face shape, jawline, skin tone, wrinkles, bone structure, and any other distinctive age-related or identity-specific features. Use the following description to match the subject exactly: [Insert facial identity description here]. This can include features such as round cheeks, sharp chin, deep smile lines, soft jawline, beard, stubble, fine forehead wrinkles, dimples, expressive eyebrows, or glasses. Do not alter or stylize the face, skin texture, or age markers in any way. If the subject has facial hair, replicate it faithfully. If the subject is clean-shaven, do not add any facial hair. If the subject wears makeup or accessories in the reference, reflect it accordingly in Manhwa style. The subject should be dressed in K-pop idol stagewear — such as crop jackets, statement blazers, bomber coats, stylish shirts, or layered streetwear — styled with silver accessories like earrings, chains, rings, headset mics, or in-ear monitors. The outfit and pose should change with each variation, but the subject’s face, age, and features must remain unchanged. The background must depict a Korean concert stage with red neon signs in Hangul (no English), soft spotlight beams, ambient haze, and layered lighting. The scene should be dynamic and performance-driven, with the stage environment and glow effects changing in every variation. This illustration must strictly follow modern Korean Manhwa style — clean linework, flat pastel cel shading, soft skin glow, and stylized lighting. Avoid realism, anime, or overly smoothed visuals. Do not alter the face structure, apply V-shaped chins, or reduce visible age. All facial identity and expression must match the original reference with 100% accuracy."
